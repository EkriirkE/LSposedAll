# LSposedAll
 Enable/check all packages for certain LSposed modules, sicne the LSposed maintainer refuses to add this fucntionality.  This script is handy for new installs or mass-app downloads where checking all the boxes becomes too tedious.
 
Run as root (in termux).

Currently this will only enable the following modules for all packges:  
-  Disable Flag Secure 2  
-  Hide Mock Locations  
-  XPrivacyLua  
-  Scoop

A reboot is required for changes to take effect.
